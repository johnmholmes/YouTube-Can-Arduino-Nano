# Can_Button_v2

This is a more useful sketch, but still very easy to understand.

I will explain sendMessage()

1. Function Signiture.

   void sendMessage(const char* message) {

   void: The function does not return any value.

   sendMessage: The name of the function.

   const char* message: The function takes a parameter named message, which is a pointer to a constant character (a string).
